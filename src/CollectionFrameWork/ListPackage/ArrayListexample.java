 Array disadvantages :
	-It is fixed in size
	-If remaining array positions you are not using into 
     the entire program unnecessary wastage of memory.
 	-Homogeneous that means we can pass only one data type eg. int.
 	-Array has no predefined method support like that of String class 
 	 It has only .length
 	
 	This is the reason why collection frameworks were introduced.
*/

/*Collection Framework

	-It is variable in terms of size at runtime.
	-It is heterogenoues.
	-Predefined method support.
	-Collection automatically type casts data into objects.
